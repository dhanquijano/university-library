# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements inventory management functionality within the admin panel with role-based access control. The system will provide managers with limited permissions to view inventory items and stock movements, while offering comprehensive analytics and filtering capabilities for inventory cost tracking across different branches.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a Manager, I want to access inventory management with limited permissions, so that I can view inventory data without having full administrative control.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user with "Manager" role accesses the inventory management section THEN the system SHALL display only the "Items" and "Stock Movement" tabs
2. WHEN a Manager views the inventory interface THEN the system SHALL hide all other tabs that are not "Items" or "Stock Movement"
3. WHEN a Manager views inventory data THEN the system SHALL ensure they can only perform read operations

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a Manager, I want to see total items from all branches by default, so that I can get a comprehensive overview of inventory across the entire organization.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a Manager opens the inventory management page THEN the system SHALL display items from all branches by default
2. WHEN the default view loads THEN the system SHALL show aggregated inventory counts across all branches
3. WHEN displaying total items THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate that data represents all branches

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a Manager, I want to filter inventory by specific branches, so that I can focus on inventory data for particular locations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a Manager accesses the inventory page THEN the system SHALL provide a branch filter dropdown
2. WHEN a Manager selects a specific branch from the filter THEN the system SHALL update the display to show only that branch's inventory
3. WHEN a Manager selects multiple branches THEN the system SHALL display combined data for selected branches
4. WHEN a Manager clears the branch filter THEN the system SHALL return to showing all branches

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a Manager, I want to view stock movement history, so that I can track inventory changes and understand stock flow patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a Manager accesses the Stock Movement tab THEN the system SHALL display a chronological list of inventory transactions
2. WHEN viewing stock movements THEN the system SHALL show transaction type, quantity, date, and branch information
3. WHEN a Manager applies branch filters THEN the system SHALL filter stock movements accordingly
4. WHEN displaying stock movements THEN the system SHALL support pagination for large datasets

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a Manager, I want to access inventory cost analytics, so that I can understand spending patterns and make informed decisions about inventory management.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a Manager accesses inventory analytics THEN the system SHALL provide cost spending reports for each branch
2. WHEN viewing cost analytics THEN the system SHALL offer daily, weekly, and monthly reporting periods
3. WHEN a Manager selects a reporting period THEN the system SHALL update the analytics to show data for that timeframe
4. WHEN displaying cost reports THEN the system SHALL show spending trends, comparisons, and totals per branch

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a Manager, I want to see visual representations of inventory costs, so that I can quickly identify trends and patterns in spending.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing inventory cost reports THEN the system SHALL display charts and graphs for visual analysis
2. WHEN a Manager changes the time period THEN the system SHALL update visualizations accordingly
3. WHEN displaying analytics THEN the system SHALL show cost breakdowns by category, branch, and time period
4. WHEN viewing cost trends THEN the system SHALL highlight significant changes or anomalies

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to ensure proper role-based access control, so that managers cannot perform unauthorized inventory operations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system loads inventory management THEN it SHALL verify the user's role and permissions
2. WHEN a Manager attempts unauthorized actions THEN the system SHALL prevent the action and log the attempt
3. WHEN role permissions change THEN the system SHALL immediately update the user's access level
4. WHEN displaying UI elements THEN the system SHALL hide or disable features not available to the Manager role
