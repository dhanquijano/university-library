# Manager Branch Filtering Implementation

## Summary
Implemented automatic branch filtering for manager accounts in the inventory system, specifically for stock movements and item requests.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated RequestOrders Component (`components/admin/inventory/RequestOrders.tsx`)

**Branch Selection Auto-Selection for Managers:**
- Added `useAdminRole` hook to detect manager role and get user's branch
- Auto-selects manager's branch when creating item requests
- Hides branch selection dropdown for managers
- Shows read-only branch display for managers with "Your assigned branch" label
- Maintains full branch selection functionality for admins

**Key Features:**
- Managers can only create requests for their assigned branch
- Branch is automatically populated and cannot be changed
- Clear visual indication that the branch is auto-assigned
- Prevents managers from accidentally creating requests for other branches

### 2. Updated StockMovement Component (`components/admin/inventory/StockMovement.tsx`)

**Automatic Branch Filtering for Managers:**
- Added `useAdminRole` hook to detect manager role and get user's branch
- Hides branch filter component for managers
- Shows read-only branch display for managers with "Your Branch" badge
- Stock movements are automatically filtered by manager's branch in parent component

**Key Features:**
- Managers only see stock movements for their assigned branch
- No ability to change branch filter (hidden for managers)
- Clear visual indication of which branch they're viewing
- Maintains full branch filtering functionality for admins

### 3. Updated Inventory Page (`app/admin/inventory/page.tsx`)

**Enhanced Data Filtering Logic:**
- Modified `getFilteredData()` function to handle manager branch filtering
- Automatically filters all data (items, transactions, orders) by manager's branch
- Maintains existing branch filter functionality for admins
- Updated component props to pass filtered data

**Filtering Logic:**
```typescript
// For managers, automatically filter by their branch
if (stableIsManager && user?.branch) {
  baseItems = inventoryItems.filter(item => item.branch === user.branch);
  baseTransactions = stockTransactions.filter(transaction => 
    transaction.branch === user.branch
  );
  baseOrders = purchaseOrders.filter(order => order.branch === user.branch);
}
```

## User Experience by Role

### ADMIN Users
- **Full Access**: Can view and manage all branches
- **Branch Filtering**: Can use branch filters to focus on specific branches
- **Item Requests**: Can select any branch when creating requests
- **Stock Movements**: Can view movements across all branches with filtering options

### MANAGER Users
- **Branch-Restricted Access**: Only see data for their assigned branch
- **No Branch Selection**: Branch filters are hidden, branch is auto-selected
- **Item Requests**: Automatically creates requests for their assigned branch only
- **Stock Movements**: Only see movements for their assigned branch
- **Visual Indicators**: Clear badges and messages showing "Your Branch" or "Your assigned branch"

### STAFF Users
- **Same as Managers**: Branch-restricted access to their assigned branch
- **Limited Functionality**: May have additional restrictions based on role permissions

## Technical Implementation

### Branch Detection
- Uses `useAdminRole()` hook to get `userRole` and `userBranch`
- Checks `userRole === "MANAGER"` to determine if branch filtering should be applied
- Uses `userBranch` value to filter data automatically

### Data Flow
1. **Page Level**: `getFilteredData()` applies manager branch filtering first
2. **Component Level**: Components receive pre-filtered data
3. **UI Level**: Branch selection controls are conditionally hidden/shown
4. **Visual Feedback**: Clear indicators show which branch is being viewed

### Backward Compatibility
- All existing functionality for admins remains unchanged
- No breaking changes to existing API or component interfaces
- Graceful handling of users without assigned branches

## Security Benefits
- Managers cannot accidentally view or modify data from other branches
- Prevents data leakage between branches
- Enforces proper data segregation at the UI level
- Complements server-side access controls

## Future Enhancements
- Could extend to other inventory components (analytics, reports, etc.)
- Could add branch assignment management for admins
- Could implement more granular permissions within branches
