# Role-Based Admin Panel Access - Verification

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Admin Layout (`app/admin/layout.tsx`)
- **Before**: Only allowed "ADMIN" role
- **After**: Allows "ADMIN", "MANAGER", and "STAFF" roles
- Uses new `hasAdminAccess()` utility function

### 2. Updated User Roles Constants (`constants/index.ts`)
- **Before**: Only had "USER" and "ADMIN" roles
- **After**: Added "MANAGER" and "STAFF" roles with proper styling
- All roles now use uppercase values to match database schema

### 3. Created Admin Utilities (`lib/admin-utils.ts`)
- `hasAdminAccess()`: Checks if user can access admin panel
- `isFullAdmin()`: Checks for full admin privileges
- `isManagerOrAbove()`: Checks for manager-level access
- `getRoleDisplayInfo()`: Gets role styling information
- `getAdminNavItems()`: Role-based navigation filtering

### 4. Updated Admin Sidebar (`components/admin/Sidebar.tsx`)
- Now uses role-based navigation
- STAFF users see limited options (Appointments only)
- MANAGER users see more options (no full admin features)
- ADMIN users see all options

## Role Permissions

### ADMIN
- ✅ Full admin panel access
- ✅ All navigation items visible
- ✅ Complete system control

### MANAGER
- ✅ Admin panel access
- ✅ Appointments management
- ✅ Inventory management
- ✅ Sales management
- ✅ Staff scheduling
- ❌ User management (if exists)

### STAFF
- ✅ Admin panel access
- ✅ Appointments management only
- ❌ Inventory management
- ❌ Sales management
- ❌ Staff scheduling

### USER
- ❌ No admin panel access
- ❌ Redirected to home page

## Testing Instructions

### 1. Test Admin Panel Access
```bash
# Create test users with different roles
# Login as MANAGER or STAFF user
# Navigate to /admin
# Should successfully access admin panel
```

### 2. Test Navigation Filtering
```bash
# Login as STAFF user
# Should only see "All Appointments" in sidebar
# Login as MANAGER user  
# Should see most admin features
# Login as ADMIN user
# Should see all features
```

### 3. Test Role Validation
```bash
# Login as regular USER
# Try to access /admin
# Should be redirected to home page
```

## Database Requirements

Ensure your database has the updated role enum:
```sql
-- This should already exist in your schema
CREATE TYPE "public"."role" AS ENUM('USER', 'ADMIN', 'MANAGER', 'STAFF');
```

## Header Component
The header component (`components/Header.tsx`) already correctly shows the admin panel link for MANAGER and STAFF roles:

```typescript
{(session?.user?.role === "ADMIN" ||
  session?.user?.role === "MANAGER" ||
  session?.user?.role === "STAFF") && (
  <li>
    <a href="/admin" className="text-lg text-primary">
      Admin Panel
    </a>
  </li>
)}
```

## Expected Behavior

1. **MANAGER and STAFF users** can now click "Admin Panel" and successfully access the admin dashboard
2. **Navigation is filtered** based on role permissions
3. **Regular users** are still blocked from admin access
4. **Role-based styling** is applied consistently across the application

- `app/admin/layout.tsx` - Updated access control
- `constants/index.ts` - Added new roles
- `lib/admin-utils.ts` - New utility functions
