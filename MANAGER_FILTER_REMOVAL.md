# Manager Branch Filter Removal

## Summary
Removed branch filter controls for manager accounts in the inventory management system since managers are automatically filtered to see only their branch data.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Inventory Page (`app/admin/inventory/page.tsx`)

**Enhanced Branch Filter Logic:**
- Added `getBranchFilterProps()` helper function to provide appropriate props based on user role
- For managers: Returns empty `selectedBranches` array and no-op `onBranchChange` function
- For admins: Returns full branch filtering functionality
- Updated `handleBranchChange()` to prevent branch changes for managers

**Key Implementation:**
```typescript
const getBranchFilterProps = () => {
  if (stableIsManager) {
    // Managers don't need branch filters - they're auto-filtered
    return {
      selectedBranches: [],
      onBranchChange: () => {}, // No-op function
    };
  }
  // Admins get full branch filtering functionality
  return {
    selectedBranches,
    onBranchChange: handleBranchChange,
  };
};
```

**Updated Component Props:**
- All inventory components now use `{...getBranchFilterProps()}` spread operator
- Ensures consistent behavior across all tabs and components
- Maintains backward compatibility for admin users

### 2. Updated InventoryDashboard Component (`components/admin/inventory/InventoryDashboard.tsx`)

**Branch Filter Visibility:**
- Added `useAdminRole()` hook to detect manager role
- Conditionally renders `BranchFilter` component only for non-managers
- Maintains clean dashboard layout for managers

**Implementation:**
```typescript
const { userRole } = useAdminRole();
const isManager = userRole === "MANAGER";

// In render:
{!isManager && (
  <BranchFilter
    branches={branches}
    selectedBranches={selectedBranches}
    onBranchChange={onBranchChange}
  />
)}
```

### 3. Updated CostAnalytics Component (`components/admin/inventory/CostAnalytics.tsx`)

**Branch Filter Visibility:**
- Added `useAdminRole()` hook to detect manager role
- Conditionally renders `BranchFilter` component only for non-managers
- Provides cleaner analytics view for managers

**Implementation:**
```typescript
const { userRole } = useAdminRole();
const isManager = userRole === "MANAGER";

// In render:
{!isManager && (
  <BranchFilter
    branches={branches}
    selectedBranches={selectedBranches}
    onBranchChange={onBranchChange}
  />
)}
```

### 4. Existing Component Behavior Maintained

**Components Already Handled:**
- `StockMovement` - Already hides branch filter for managers
- `RequestOrders` - Already hides branch selection for managers
- `ItemManagement` - Uses filtered data, no additional changes needed
- `AdminApproval` - Admin-only component, no changes needed

## User Experience by Role

### ADMIN Users
- **Full Functionality**: All branch filters remain visible and functional
- **Multi-Branch View**: Can filter and view data across all branches
- **Complete Control**: All filtering options available

### MANAGER Users
- **Streamlined Interface**: No branch filter controls visible
- **Auto-Filtered Data**: Only see data from their assigned branch
- **Cleaner UI**: Reduced clutter and confusion
- **Focused Experience**: Interface optimized for single-branch management

## Technical Benefits

### Performance
- **Reduced Complexity**: Managers don't need to handle branch selection logic
- **Simplified State**: No unnecessary branch filter state for managers
- **Cleaner Props**: Components receive appropriate props based on role

### User Experience
- **Less Confusion**: Managers can't accidentally try to filter by other branches
- **Cleaner Interface**: Removes unnecessary UI elements for managers
- **Consistent Behavior**: All components behave consistently for managers

### Maintainability
- **Centralized Logic**: Branch filter behavior controlled in one place
- **Role-Based Props**: Easy to extend for other roles in the future
- **Consistent Pattern**: Same approach used across all components

## Implementation Details

### Prop Spreading Pattern
```typescript
// Before (for all users):
<Component
  selectedBranches={selectedBranches}
  onBranchChange={handleBranchChange}
  // ... other props
/>

// After (role-based):
<Component
  {...getBranchFilterProps()}
  // ... other props
/>
```

### Conditional Rendering Pattern
```typescript
// In components:
{!isManager && (
  <BranchFilter
    branches={branches}
    selectedBranches={selectedBranches}
    onBranchChange={onBranchChange}
  />
)}
```

## Data Flow

### For Managers
1. **Page Level**: `getBranchFilterProps()` returns empty arrays and no-op functions
2. **Component Level**: Components receive empty filter props
3. **UI Level**: Branch filter components are hidden
4. **Data Level**: Data is already filtered by manager's branch

### For Admins
1. **Page Level**: `getBranchFilterProps()` returns full filter functionality
2. **Component Level**: Components receive active filter props
3. **UI Level**: Branch filter components are visible and functional
4. **Data Level**: Data is filtered based on admin's selections

## Future Considerations
- Could extend this pattern to other role-based UI elements
- Could add role-specific dashboard layouts
- Could implement more granular permissions within roles
- Could add role-based feature toggles

## Testing Scenarios
- ✅ Manager login: No branch filters visible
- ✅ Admin login: All branch filters visible and functional
- ✅ Role switching: UI updates appropriately
- ✅ Data integrity: Managers still see only their branch data
- ✅ Functionality: All existing features work for both roles
