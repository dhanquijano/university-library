# Branch Name Resolution Implementation

## Summary
Implemented proper branch name resolution throughout the inventory system to display actual branch names (like "Ayala Mall Circuit") instead of branch IDs (like "branch-1").

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced Admin Utils (`lib/admin-utils.ts`)

**New Branch Resolution Functions:**
- `useBranchMap()` - Client-side hook that fetches all branches and provides name lookup
- `getBranchMap()` - Server-side function to get branch ID to name mapping
- Removed individual branch name fetching in favor of efficient batch loading

**Key Features:**
```typescript
const { getBranchName, branchMap, isLoading } = useBranchMap();
const branchName = getBranchName(branchId); // Returns actual name or ID as fallback
```

### 2. New API Endpoint (`app/api/inventory/branches/[id]/route.ts`)

**Single Branch Lookup:**
- GET `/api/inventory/branches/[id]` - Fetch individual branch by ID
- Returns complete branch information including name
- Used for fallback lookups when needed

### 3. Updated Inventory Components

**RequestOrders Component:**
- ✅ Branch selection shows actual branch names
- ✅ Manager's assigned branch displays proper name
- ✅ Request table shows branch names instead of IDs
- ✅ Request details modal shows branch names

**StockMovement Component:**
- ✅ Manager branch indicator shows proper name
- ✅ All branch references resolved to names
- ✅ Maintains filtering functionality with name resolution

**ItemManagement Component:**
- ✅ Item table displays branch names
- ✅ Branch selection dropdowns show names
- ✅ All item displays use proper branch names

**AdminApproval Component:**
- ✅ Request tables show branch names
- ✅ All branch references properly resolved

**BranchManagerInfo Component:**
- ✅ Updated to use new branch resolution system
- ✅ Displays proper branch name for managers
- ✅ Removed dependency on debug API

### 4. Updated Inventory Page (`app/admin/inventory/page.tsx`)

**Enhanced Filtering Logic:**
- Updated `getFilteredData()` to handle both branch IDs and names
- Maintains compatibility with existing data structure
- Proper branch name resolution for manager filtering

**Branch Resolution in Filtering:**
```typescript
// Handles both ID and name matching
baseItems = inventoryItems.filter(item => 
  item.branch === user.branch || getBranchName(item.branch) === userBranchName
);
```

## Technical Implementation

### Branch Data Flow
1. **Initial Load**: `useBranchMap()` fetches all branches from `/api/inventory/branches`
2. **Mapping Creation**: Creates `branchId -> branchName` lookup map
3. **Name Resolution**: `getBranchName(id)` provides instant lookup
4. **Fallback Handling**: Returns original ID if name not found

### Performance Optimization
- **Single API Call**: All branches loaded once, not per component
- **Cached Lookup**: Branch map cached in memory for fast access
- **Efficient Rendering**: No additional API calls during rendering
- **Fallback Strategy**: Graceful degradation if branch name not found

### Data Compatibility
- **Backward Compatible**: Works with existing branch ID references
- **Mixed Data Support**: Handles both IDs and names in data
- **Graceful Fallback**: Shows ID if name resolution fails
- **No Breaking Changes**: Existing functionality preserved

## User Experience Improvements

### Before
- Users saw cryptic branch IDs like "branch-1", "branch-2"
- Difficult to identify which branch was which
- Poor user experience and confusion

### After
- Users see meaningful names like "Ayala Mall Circuit", "SM Megamall"
- Clear identification of branches
- Professional appearance
- Consistent naming throughout the system

## Branch Name Examples

| Branch ID | Branch Name |
|-----------|-------------|
| branch-1 | Ayala Mall Circuit |
| branch-2 | SM Megamall |
| branch-3 | Greenbelt Mall |
| branch-4 | Trinoma |

## Error Handling
- **Network Failures**: Falls back to showing branch ID
- **Missing Branches**: Shows original ID if not found in map
- **Loading States**: Proper loading indicators during fetch
- **Graceful Degradation**: System remains functional even if names can't be resolved

## Future Enhancements
- Could add branch name caching in localStorage
- Could implement real-time branch updates
- Could add branch name validation
- Could extend to other parts of the system (appointments, sales, etc.)

## Testing Considerations
- Test with various branch ID formats
- Verify fallback behavior when API fails
- Check performance with large numbers of branches
- Validate manager filtering with proper names
